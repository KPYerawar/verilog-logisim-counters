# 🔁 Verilog + Logisim Counters

This repository contains digital counters designed using **Verilog HDL** and simulated using **Icarus Verilog** and **GTKWave**. The same counters are also modeled visually using **Logisim Evolution**, making this a great learning project for digital electronics and logic design
